## MyFrap

This is a ReactJS app that currently allows users to find and view Frappuccino recipes from an external API.
This isnt a serious project and was made for me to practice alittle bit of React in a lighthearted environment, 
and it helps fight boredom.

## This is still a WIP.

What I hope to add in the near futue:
More recipes to view rather than just 10.
More information per Frappuccino product.
A proper about me page, the current one is just a simple place holder.
Properly format certain texts, like the calories and nutritional informations.
Proper navigation and footer.
More functionality, such as a "random" button to randomly select a frappuccino recipe to view.

Much more...
